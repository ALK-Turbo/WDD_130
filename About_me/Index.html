            Welcome to the life of Ammon Keller. It all
            started about 24 years ago. <br>I was born in Northern Idaho and
            moved to Ohio when I was five. If someone were to ask me where
            I grew up my answer would be Ohio. Don't ask me what town cause
            no one has ever heard of it.<br>
            I am majoring in Manufacturing Engineering and Technology. I
            love coding and so I decided to work towards and emphasis in
            CIT. It won't show up on my diploma, but I am only doing it for
            the knowledge anyway. <br> Hobbies: 3D printing, Inventing, coding
            offroading, hiking, long walks with my wife.<br> I am married to my
            beautiful wife Jessica as you can see in the picture. We will be celebrating
            our first annivisary Sept 25th. <br> I am currently working two part time
            jobs, but will be finishing up the one here soon. I will work for Zetec inc.
            <br> I hope to be able to use my knowledge that I gain here in these classes to
            better those around me and help my companies move forward.
            <br>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for
            all of my life.
