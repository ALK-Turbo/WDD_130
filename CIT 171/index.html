<body>
    <p>Data loss prevention (DLP) makes sure that users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the
        corporate network. The term describes software products that help a network administrator control the data that
        users can transfer. DLP products use business rules to classify and protect confidential and critical
        information so that unauthorized users cannot accidentally or maliciously share data, which would put the
        organization at risk. For example, if an employee tried to forward a business email outside the corporate domain
        or upload a corporate file to a consumer cloud storage service like Dropbox, the employee would be denied
        permission.</p>

        <li>Enforece security policies and procedures </li>
